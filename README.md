Slides and code for Kenny Smith's tutorial at [Experimental Methods in
Language Acquisition Research](https://emlar.wp.hum.uu.nl), April 2023.

NB Word stimuli in the Martin & White (2021) example were provided by Alex Martin and can also be found on his personal website and OSF page.

These are developed from [a 2021 workshop I did with Shira Tal](https://github.com/kennysmithed/evwall_talsmith) - basically slightly different slides and an update of the example experiments to jsPsych7.3, plus I added an image-audio-button-response plugin for the Martin & White (2021) demo experiment.
